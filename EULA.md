## 1. Grant of License

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, single-seat license to use ACHA Pro ("Software") for your internal business or personal use.

**Single-Seat License:** One (1) named individual may use this Software on multiple machines owned or controlled by that individual.

---

## 2. Scope of Use

You may:
- Use the Software on any number of devices you personally own or control
- Use the Software for commercial or non-commercial projects
- Generate reports, perform code analysis, and apply refactorings to your codebases
- Integrate the Software into your development workflows

You may **NOT**:
- Share your license file with other individuals
- Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the license verification mechanism
- Remove or modify any license verification code
- Sublicense, rent, lease, or lend the Software to third parties
- Use the Software to provide services to third parties as a service bureau

---

## 3. License Verification

The Software uses offline Ed25519 cryptographic signature verification to validate your license. The license check:
- Operates entirely offline (no network calls)
- Does not transmit any data externally
- Does not collect telemetry or usage statistics
- Validates the license file signature and expiration date locally

Your license file (`license.json`) must be placed in one of the following locations:
- `~/.acha/license.json` (recommended for user-wide installation)
- `./license.json` (project-specific installation)

The license file contains:
- Your name or organization name
- License expiration date (if applicable)
- Ed25519 cryptographic signature
- No personal identifying information beyond what you provide

---

## 4. Privacy & Data Collection

**ACHA Pro does NOT:**
- Make any network connections
- Send telemetry, analytics, or crash reports
- Upload your code or analysis results
- Track your usage patterns
- Collect any personal information
- "Phone home" for any reason

All processing occurs entirely on your local machine. Your code never leaves your environment.

---

## 5. Ownership & Intellectual Property

The Software, including all code, algorithms, documentation, and the license verification mechanism, remains the exclusive property of the Licensor. This Agreement does not grant you any ownership rights to the Software.

**Output Ownership:** All code analysis reports, refactoring patches, and other outputs generated by the Software are your property.

---

## 6. Prohibited Reverse Engineering

You agree not to:
- Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the license verification mechanism
- Attempt to circumvent or bypass license checks
- Create derivative works of the license validation system
- Publicly distribute methods to bypass license validation

The Software is provided as-is for its intended use. Security research for the purpose of improving the Software is welcome if responsibly disclosed to the vendor.

---

## 7. Warranty Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The Licensor does not warrant that:
- The Software will be error-free or uninterrupted
- All defects will be corrected
- The Software will meet your specific requirements
- The Software is suitable for any particular purpose

---

## 8. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

**Code Modification Safety:** While ACHA Pro includes safety rails (dirty tree checks, backups, confirmation prompts), you are responsible for:
- Maintaining version control (git) for all codebases
- Reviewing all refactoring patches before applying them
- Testing changes in isolated environments
- Maintaining independent backups of your code

---

## 9. Support & Updates

**Support:** Basic email support is provided for license activation and technical issues. No SLA is guaranteed.

**Updates:** Minor updates (bug fixes, security patches) are provided free of charge for the duration of your license. Major version upgrades may require a separate purchase.

Refunds are not available if:
- You change your mind after the 30-day window

To request a refund, contact support with your order number and reason.

---

## 11. Termination

This license is effective until terminated. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice if you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement.

Upon termination, you must:

Termination does not affect your right to retain outputs (reports, patches) generated before termination.
