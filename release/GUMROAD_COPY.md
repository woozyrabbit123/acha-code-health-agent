# ACHA Pro v1.0.0

**Autonomous Code-Health Agent for Professional Python Developers**

ACHA Pro is a production-grade Python code analysis and automated refactoring tool designed for developers who value **privacy, reproducibility, and safety**.

## 🔐 Privacy-First Design

- **100% offline** - No network connections, ever
- **Zero telemetry** - Your code never leaves your machine
- **Offline licensing** - Ed25519 cryptographic signatures (via PyNaCl)
- **Local-only processing** - All analysis happens on your hardware
- **No vendor lock-in** - Standard JSON/SARIF output formats

## ✨ Pro Features

### 📊 Self-Contained HTML Reports
Beautiful, interactive reports with **no CDN dependencies**. Filter by severity, rule type, or baseline status. Show suppressed findings with badges. Works 100% offline.

### 📈 Baseline Tracking
Track code health over time. Create baselines, compare changes, and focus only on **new issues**. Perfect for legacy codebases and gradual improvements.

### 🔍 Pre-commit Integration
Block commits with high-severity findings. Scan only staged files for fast feedback. Integrates seamlessly with git hooks.

### ⚡ Parallel Scanning
Use all your CPU cores with `--jobs N`. **Deterministic output** guaranteed—parallel and sequential produce identical results.

### 🛡️ Safety Rails for Refactoring
Automated refactoring with built-in safety:
- Dirty tree detection (warns if uncommitted changes)
- Automatic backups before changes
- User confirmation prompts
- Rollback mechanisms

## 🌟 Community Features (Always Free)

All these features work **without a license** (MIT open source):
- AST-based code analysis (complexity, unused imports, magic numbers, etc.)
- JSON and SARIF report generation
- Automated refactoring (planning mode with `--fix`)
- Inline suppression (`# acha: disable=RULE`)
- Policy enforcement and quality gates
- Test validation workflows
- Deterministic outputs for reproducible builds
